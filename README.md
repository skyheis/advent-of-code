# ðŸŽ„ advent-of-code in Go ðŸŽ„

This year my mom didn't buy me a chocolate advent calendar (maybe it's beacuse I'm 26), so I decided to do something about it... Christmas is so cool and I didn't wanna miss the routine of waiting for the 25th as of tradition!

This past year I focused on 42 school to learn to code while working as a sysadmin, and, now that I've completed the core curriculum, it's time to learn new programming languages.

I like OOP a lot, but C was my first true love, so I've decided to learn [Go](https://go.dev/)!

I thing Go has the potential to be one of the best languages for what I like to program in CS, and it's also fast, very documented, fully supported by the community, and parent to a lot of tools that I use at work, such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [JuiceFS](https://juicefs.com/en/) (big UPs to them!), [Treafik](https://traefik.io/traefik/), [k6](https://k6.io/), and so on and forth...

So yeah, this is my first journey in [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/)! I hope this will be the first of a long series (but please, mom, buy me a chocolate advent calendar!).
