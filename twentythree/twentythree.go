	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	TwentythreeCmd.PersistentFlags().BoolP("subject", "s", false, "Print the subject of the day before the result")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// twentythreeCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
